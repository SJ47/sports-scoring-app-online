As a huge fan of [your sport], you want to stay up to date with the league.
You're interested to see which team leads the table and who won the latest games/matches/fixtures/bouts.

There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game.
The app should display if a game was won or lost.

Possible Extensions
Create a league table to see who is on top of the league.
Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.).
Anything else you can think of.
